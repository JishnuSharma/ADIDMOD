                    I'm an Associate Software Developer with 1.5 years of
                    hands-on experience in building full-stack web applications.
                    I specialize in the MERN stack and have contributed to
                    scalable system development, focusing on clean code,
                    performance optimization, and seamless user experiences. I
                    enjoy collaborating with teams, mentoring interns, and
                    tackling real-world problems through technology. I'm also
                    passionate about continuous learningâ€”currently deepening my
                    skills in state management, backend architecture with
                    Node.js and TypeScript, and modern frontend tools like
                    Tailwind CSS. My goal is to grow into a well-rounded
                    developer capable of delivering impactful software
                    solutions.
